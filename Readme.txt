InlineC examples 

Raylib 4 
SoundRecorder 

To use InclineC in Purebasic you either need to have a full c install like mingw64 or you can extract the include.zip to 
"C:\PureBasic\Compilers\gcc\" 

Next Edit your environment variables by adding CPATH variable and set it to the include folder and restart the IDE

Alternatively if you want to install mingw64

you probably want a UCRT version for windows 10 and above and compatibility with pb
edit your environment variables adding CPATH and add two folders from you minwgW64 install eg
C:\mingw64\include
C:\mingw64\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\13.2.0\include
